# Fair search DELTR for Python

This is the Python library that serves as wrapper for the [DELTR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08716.pdf) model 
for fair ranking in [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) with the [Learning to Rank plugin](https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requirements


## Credits

The DELTR algorithm is described in this paper:

A Learning to Rank Approach](https://doi.org/10.1145/3132847.3132938)." arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.08716 (2018).

This library was developed by [Ivan Kitanovski](http://ivankitanovski.com/) based on the paper. See the [license](https://github.com/fair-search/fairsearch-deltr-for-elasticsearch/blob/master/LICENSE) file for more information.
